yum -y erase httpd nginx
yum -y install epel-release
yum -y update
yum -y install lighttpd


First, make sure mod_proxy is installed and activated in your lighttpd config file. Afterwards, paste the following lines to your config file and amend them appropriate:

$HTTP["host"] == "yourapp.yourhost.com" { 
  proxy.server = (
    "" => (( "host" => "127.0.0.1", 
             "port" => 9001) // your Node.js app's port 
    )
  )
Make sure to specify an IP address and not hostnames as this is a requirement of mod_proxy.

Now you are ready to run your Node.js app. Your app will be available at https://yourapp.yourhost.com after restarting lighttpd.


Make sure you enable lighttpd's mod_proxy first. To have all of the requests for test.com sent to the Node.js backend (assuming it's on localhost; correct?):

$HTTP["host"] == "test.com" {
  proxy.server  = ( "" => (
    ( "host" => "127.0.0.1", "port" => 3000 )
  ) )
}
